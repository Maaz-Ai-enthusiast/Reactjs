# CRUD App

This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with React. It allows users to manage a list of items, where each item has a name and price. The app uses local storage to persist data.

## Features

- Add new items to the list
- Edit existing items
- Delete items from the list
- Data persists in local storage

## Technologies Used

- React
- pnpm (package manager)
- Tailwind CSS (for styling, if used)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have `pnpm` installed on your machine. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so with the following command:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-repo-name>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app in action.

## Usage
